# Meme Sharing App

This is a simple Meme sharing app which uses a meme API. This was made as a way to test my android coding skills and I am pretty happy with the outcome.
  
The UI is kept minimal with a mono coloured theme followed by an added "Download" button.
You can enjoy memes and can even download them.

## Installation

Installation is pretty easy. 
You just need to import this project into your Android Studio and then simply build it.
You can run it on android 5 or higher.
